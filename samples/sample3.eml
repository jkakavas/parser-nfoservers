You appear to be running an open recursive resolver at IP address 195.251.4=
.195 that participated in an attack against a customer of ours, generating =
large UDP responses to spoofed queries, with those responses becoming fragm=
ented because of their size.

Please consider reconfiguring your resolver in one or more of these ways:

- To only serve your customers and not respond to outside IP addresses (in =
BIND, this is done by defining a limited set of hosts in "allow-query"; wit=
h a Windows DNS server, you would need to use firewall rules to block exter=
nal access to UDP port 53)
- To only serve domains that it is authoritative for (in BIND, this is done=
 by defining a limited set of hosts in "allow-query" for the server overall=
 but setting "allow-query" to "any" for each zone)
- To rate-limit responses to individual source IP addresses (such as by usi=
ng DNS Response Rate Limiting or iptables rules)

More information on this type of attack and what each party can do to mitig=
ate it can be found here: http://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA13-088A

If you are an ISP, please also look at your network configuration and make =
sure that you do not allow spoofed traffic (that pretends to be from extern=
al IP addresses) to leave the network. Hosts that allow spoofed traffic mak=
e possible this type of attack.

Example DNS responses from your resolver during this attack are given below=

(The final octet of our customer's IP address is masked in the above output=
 because some automatic parsers become confused when multiple IP addresses =
are included. The value of that octet is "158".)
