An IP address (195.251.233.156) under your control appears to have attacked=
 one of our customers as part of a coordinated DDoS botnet. We manually rev=
iewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address=
 was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, t=
he identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the pa=
st, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses.=20
=20=20
It is likely that this host is one of the following, from the responses tha=
t others have sent us:

- A compromised DVR, such as a "Hikvision" brand device (ref: http://www.co=
resecurity.com/advisories/hikvision-ip-cameras-multiple-vulnerabilities)
- A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by Supermicro (possibly becau=
se it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found=
 through an exploit described at http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/06/at=
-least-32000-servers-broadcast-admin-passwords-in-the-clear-advisory-warns/)
- A compromised router, such as one made by China Telecom which still allow=
s a default admin username and password; one by Netis, with its built-in in=
ternet-accessible backdoor (http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-i=
ntelligence/netis-routers-leave-wide-open-backdoor/); or one running an old=
 AirOS version with its exposed administrative interface
- A compromised Xerox-branded device
- Some other compromised standalone device
- A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of WordPr=
ess, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel
- A compromised client, such as one running a vulnerable web browser suscep=
tible to a Java exploit
- A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through=
 SSH or RDP

The actual attack consisted of packets with specific distinguishing charact=
eristics. This is example traffic from the IP address, as put out by the "t=
cpdump" utility and captured by our router during the attack.
